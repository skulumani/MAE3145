\paragraph*{Prerequisites} APSC 2058 Analytical Mechanics II

\paragraph*{Course Description} This course covers the motion of spacecraft under gravity. Included are the derivation and the analyses of the two-body problem and their applications for real world missions.
Extensive use of scientific programming languages is required to simulate orbital dynamics and solve real-world astrodynamics problems.

\paragraph*{Software Projects}
A major focus of this course will be the application of sound scientific programming skills.
You will apply the theoretical tools of astrodynamics to solve realistic problems by implementing your own library of tools.

\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{\setlength{\itemsep}{-3pt}}
    \item RV2COE - convert position and velocity vectors of a spacecraft to classical orbital elements
    \item COMFIX - determine the orbital elements of a satellite given ground based radar observations
    \item PROPOGATE - determine the position of a satellite as a function of time
    \item PREDICT - predict satellite passes for any location on the Earth

\item Disability Support Services (DSS): If a student is to use DSS for testing, he/she should submit the letter from DSS during the first week. Any student who may need an accommodation based on the potential impact of a disability should contact the Disability Support Services office (\url{http://gwired.gwu.edu/dss/}) during the first week.

\paragraph*{Academic Integrity Code}

Academic dishonesty is defined as cheating of any kind, including misrepresenting one's own work, taking credit for the work of others without crediting them and without appropriate authorization, and the fabrication of information. 

All academic integrity violations will be reported in accordance with the GWU code of academic integrity, see: \url{http://studentconduct.gwu.edu/code-academic-integrity}.


\paragraph*{Email Policy}

\begin{list}
{$\bullet$}
{\setlength{\itemsep}{-3pt}}
