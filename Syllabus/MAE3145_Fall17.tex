Use of solutions manuals is prohibited.

\item Late homework assignment will not be accepted.
    Your lowest homework grade will be dropped and not count towards the final grade.

\item No excuse on missing exams will be accepted. Make-up exams will not be given, except under extraordinary circumstances such as documented illness. If an exam is simply missed, then a grade of zero will be recorded. If you shall have a conflict of schedule, you must inform Dr. Lee in writing with supporting documents at least a week ahead of time.

\item If you shall have any questions regarding grading, you must attach to your paper a written explanation and give them to Dr. Lee within one week after the paper is returned.

\item If you shall have any questions regarding the course, you should see Dr. Nigam during his office hours or contact him via email.
\item Set cell phone to silent mode in the classroom and refrain from texting.
 
\item Class/Lab cancellation due to weather or special event: Call 202-994-5050 or visit the Campus Advisories Website (\url{campusadvisories.gwu.edu}) or \url{www.gwu.edu/~bygeorge/100703/closingpolicy.html} for GW operating status. 

\item Disability Support Services (DSS): If a student is to use DSS for testing, he/she should submit the letter from DSS during the first week. Any student who may need an accommodation based on the potential impact of a disability should contact the Disability Support Services office (\url{http://gwired.gwu.edu/dss/}) during the first week.

\item Students requiring special accommodations for testing through DSS must provide Dr. Lee with the appropriate forms or documents and confirm the approval at least two weeks before the test or exam.
\end{list}

\paragraph*{To Report an Emergency or Suspicious Activity}

Call the GW Police Department at 202-994-6111 (Foggy Bottom). If the line is unavailable or you are calling from another University location or off campus, dial 911.


\paragraph*{Shelter in Place - General Guidance}

Your first reaction in an emergency should be to stay where you are. Evacuate only if you hear the fire alarm or someone instructs you to evacuate. If you are outdoors during an incident, proceed into the closest GW building unless you are told to do otherwise. No matter where you are on campus, the basic steps of ?sheltering in place? are:

\begin{list}
{\arabic{lcounter}:}
{\setlength{\itemsep}{-3pt}\usecounter{lcounter}}

\item	Shelter-in-place in an interior room, above ground level, and with the fewest windows. If there is a large group of people inside a particular building, several rooms may be necessary.
\item	Shut and lock all windows (locking will form a tighter seal), close exterior doors, and stay away from glass doors and windows.
\item	Turn off air conditioners, heaters, and fans. Close vents to ventilation systems as you are able (Facilities staff will turn off ventilation systems as quickly as possible).
\item	Make a list of the people with you and call the list in to GWPD (see numbers above) so they know where you are.
\item	Visit GW Campus Advisories \url{http://CampusAdvisories.gwu.edu} or call the GW Information Line at 202-994-5050 for incident updates. If possible, turn on a radio or television and listen for further instructions. If your e?mail address or mobile device is registered with Alert DC, check for alert notifications.
\item	Make yourself comfortable and look after one other. You will get word as soon as it is safe to come out.
\end{list}

\paragraph*{Evacuation}

We will always evacuate if the fire alarm sounds or if the building we are in becomes unsafe. In the event of an evacuation, please quickly gather your personal belongings (purse, keys, cell phone, GWorld card, etc.) and proceed to the nearest exit. Do not use the elevator.

Once we have evacuated the building, proceed to the east entrance of SEH. If the first location is not available, we will meet at Marvin Center (800 21st Street, in the lobby)


\paragraph*{Alert DC \& GW Alert}
Alert DC provides free notification by e-mail or text message during an emergency. Visit GW Campus Advisories for a link and instructions on how to sign up for alerts pertaining to GW. If you receive an Alert DC notification during class, please share the information immediately.
 

GW Alert provides popup notification to desktop and laptop computers during an emergency. In the event that we receive an alert to the computer in our classroom, we will follow the instructions given. You are also encouraged to download this application to your personal computer. Visit GW Campus Advisories to learn how. Additional  information  about  emergency  preparedness  at  GW  can  be  found  on  GW  Campus  Advisories \url{http://CampusAdvisories.gwu.edu}.
 

\paragraph*{University Policy on Religious Holidays}
\begin{list}
{\arabic{lcounter}:}
{\setlength{\itemsep}{-3pt}\usecounter{lcounter}}

\item Students should notify faculty during the first week of the semester of their intention to be absent from class on their day(s) of religious observance. 
\item Faculty should extend to these students the courtesy of absence without penalty on such occasions, including permission to make up examinations. 
\item Faculty who intend to observe a religious holiday should arrange at the beginning of the semester to reschedule missed classes or to make other provisions for their course-related activities
\end{list}

\paragraph*{Support for Students Outside the Classroom}

\begin{itemize}
\item Disability Support Services (DSS)

Any student who may need an accommodation based on the potential impact of a disability should contact the Disability Support Services office at 202-994-8250 in the Rome Hall, Suite 102, to establish eligibility and to coordinate reasonable accommodations. For additional information please refer to: \url{http://disabilitysupport.gwu.edu}

%
%\item Grading of the homework will emphasize your effort to present the solution in a near and orderly fashion.
%\begin{list}
%{$-$}
%{\setlength{\itemsep}{-3pt}}
%\item Use one side of a clean paper (graphed or lined is okay) that is not torn from a spiral notebook.

\paragraph*{Academic Expectations for University Courses\footnote{Zucker, Steven, \textit{Teaching at the University Level}, AMS Notices (43), 1996, pp 863-865. Available at
\url{http://www.ams.org/notices/199608/comm-zucker.pdf}}}

\begin{list}
{$\bullet$}
{\setlength{\itemsep}{-3pt}}

\item You are no longer in high school. The great majority of you, not having done so already, will have to discard high school notions of teaching and learning and replace them by university-level notions.  Our goal is more than just getting you to reproduce what was told to you in the classroom.

\item Expect to have material covered at two to three times the pace of high school. Above that, we aim for greater command of the material, especially the ability to apply what you have learned to new situations (when relevant).

\item Lecture time is at a premium, so it must be used efficiently. You cannot be \textit{taught} everything in the classroom. It is your responsibility to learn the material. Most of this learning must take place outside the classroom. You should be willing to put in two hours outside the classroom for each hour of class.

\item The instructor's job is primarily to provide a framework, with some of the particulars, to guide you in doing your learning of the concepts and methods that comprise the material of the course. It is not to \textit{program} you with isolated facts and problem types nor to monitor your progress.

\item You are expected to read the textbook for comprehension. It gives the detailed account of the material of the course. It also contains many examples of problems worked out, and these should be used to supplement those you see in the lecture. 

%However, there is the clear advantage that you can read it at your own pace. Use pencil and paper to work through the material and to fill in omitted steps.
%As for when you engage the textbook, you have the following dichotomy:
%[recommended for most students] Read for the first time the appropriate section(s) of the book before the material is presented in lecture. That is, come prepared for class. Then the faster-paced college-style lecture will make more sense.
%If you haven't looked at the book beforehand, try to pick up what you can from the lecture (absorb the general idea and/or take thorough notes) and count on sorting it out later while studying from the book outside of class.

\item Exams will consist largely of \textit{fresh} problems that fall within the material that is being tested.
