%%
%%  This function finds the Julian date given the Year, Month, Day, and Time.
%%    The Julian date is defined by each elapsed day since noon, 1 Jan 4713 BC.
%%    Julian dates are measured from this epoch at noon so astronomers
%%    observations may be performed on a single "day".  The year range is
%%    limited since machine routines for 365 days a year and leap years are
%%    valid in this range only.  This is due to the fact that leap years occur
%%    only in years divisible by 4 and centuries whose number is evenly
%%    divisible by 400. ( 1900 no, 2000 yes ... )
%%
%%  NOTE:  This Algorithm is taken from the 1988 Almanac for Computers,
%%    Published by the U.S. Naval Observatory.  The algorithm is good for dates
%%    between 1 Mar 1900 to 28 Feb 2100 since the last two terms (from the
%%    Almanac) are commented out.  Including the last two terms enables
%%    calculations between 1 Mar 1801, and 2100.
