function y = revcheck (x, modby)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%
%%  Use          : y = revcheck (x, modby)
%%
%%    Accomplishes a modulus function of x by modby. While this does exactly
%%    the same operation as the MatLab mod function, it does it quicker  
%%    because the overhead is minimal. This has shown to be significant when
%%    propagating COEs at small time steps over large time spans.
%%
%%  inputs:
%%           x -  argument (radians, degrees, etc.)
%%       modby -  value to mod by (TwoPi, 360, etc.)
%%
%%  outputs:
%%           y -  x modulus modby
